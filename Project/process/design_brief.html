	<h1>Design Brief for Ellie Pierpoint's Portfolio Site</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Effective portfolio website design should compliment the aesthetic of the work and the style of the artist. It should provide easy navigation to persuade the viewer to continue perusing the content and provide clear headings to each page. Layouts that utilize negative space and minimal text to allow pictures of the work to stand out are very effective. The pieces chosen should be work that the artist wants to showcase, showing the best of their talents as well as their breadth of experience. Uniqueness is important in designing the layout to allow the artist to stand out among the millions of other portfolios. The text and descriptions should have a friendly but professional tone throughout and remain concise. Displaying an abundance of works is allowed as long as the layout of them is not too overwhelming to the viewer, and should include a variety of mediums. The website should be catered in order to confidently show potentially interested companies and clients the skill of the artist and create interest in hiring them, and provide their personal and contact information for them to do so.</p>

	<h2>Design Brief</h2>
<p>I would like to create a site for my portfolio that displays my skills and breadth of experience in different mediums. This portfolio site will be used as a way for companies in the future to view my work and hopefully hire me, so the tone should be professional yet welcoming. The navigation of this site should be seamless and straightforward, to allow for quick and easy viewing. The color scheme should be simplistic, only of a few colors, and compliment the style of my work rather than taking attention away from it. The organization of my pieces should utilize negative space so as to not overwhelm the viewer. I will provide at least 10 works in most mediums, to provide an in-depth look into my skills and personal style. Short descriptions of each piece will be provided upon clicking on each photo. The photographs of my work used should be very high quality, but also able to quickly load on any device. I hope to go into music merchandise design in the future, so I will include many pieces of musical artists and mock concert merchandise design to interest professionals in this business. I will also have an “About Me” page that explains who I am, my level of experience, my inspiration in creating my work, and my contact information. Overall, I would like my site to have visual appeal through its color palette and clean organization, be functional through quickly loading images and working links, and efficiently advertise my work to an audience of professionals.</p>
