<h2>Denys Nevo Zhai</h2>
	<p>This portfolio is so unique and stands out with the beginning of its home page allowing interactive navigation, with a picture that focuses and moves depending on where your cursor is. His introduction is short and sweet and allows for quick navigation down to his extensive and impressive timeline of his life, his work, and his accomplishments in the design field. His work is showcased in a seamless organized grid, and the movement of all his creations really draws in the eye of the viewer, and allows for interactivity in clicking for more information. The inclusion of his many awards and nominations for his work truly bring a sense of prestige and professionalism. Finally, the inclusion of his writing and extensive photography portfolio really illustrate just how talented he is to the client but does not overwhelm the viewer with their simple layout. The overall organization and interactivity of his site is clever and clean, and the simplistic color scheme and white background allow his work to shine. <a href="http://dnevozhai.com//">Visit his site!</a></p>

<h2>Maria Marie</h2>
	<p>The minimalist organization and soft color palette of this portfolio is welcoming to the viewer. Beautiful images are laid out with great use of negative space, and paired with modern thin text and blocks of pink that creates a clean and refined feel with stylistic qualities of the artist. The navigation of this site is seamless and easily scrolls down to small portions of everything she has to offer, including not only her graphic design work, but also her photography, pieces at her boutique studio, illustration work, and stop motion. Images showcasing her variety of talents are seamlessly edited together on an offset grid and the organization is professional with personality. I love how she also has included other interesting sections in her site such as her travel blog, journal, and classes she teaches, to further interest the viewer in what she has to offer. The amount of information is not overwhelming in the way it is cleanly set up and her branding is evident throughout. <br> <a href="https://mariamarie.com//">Visit her site!</a></p>

<h2>Kel Lauren</h2>
	<p>This portfolio is colorful, unique, and organized. The use of black background  and simple sans-serif text against her vibrant, complex compositions balances out well. The prestige of the musical artists she has worked for is able to stand out with lack of descriptions (until clicked on), and the beauty of her work speaks for itself. The content of her work is divided effectively into different organized sections for her variety of talents, including photography and videos. The navigation is simple in its clear organization and titles, her specific style and brand is evident throughout her work, and her clean use of a 3 columns grid throughout her site allows for easy viewing. She entices her audience well through her inclusion of Press articles written on her, YouTube channel, and a short and sweet biography at the end of her site that allows her work to shine.<br> <a href="https://www.kellylaurendesign.com/">Visit her site!</a></p>

<h2>Shiyuan Ye</h2>
	<p>This portfolio is immediately captivating and unique through its use of blobs of color in the background that continue to move as you navigate through the site. The images of her design work laid out on a 2 column grid are very professional and clean, leading to easy navigation after pressing the image. The simplistic information for the context of each presented work and use of negative space compliments the several colorful images of the printed pieces below. I especially appreciate the inclusion of online branding through apps, ads, and the like for the piece, showcasing her variety of skill. The use of a vibrant aesthetically pleasing color palette throughout ties the site together and compliments her colorful style well, and the blobs are so memorable. Her contact information is scattered on the corners of her site, helpful, but allows the viewer to focus on her work first.<br> <a href="https://www.shiyuandesign.com/">Visit her site!</a></p>

<h2>Raoul Gaillard</h2>
	<p>The interactivity and simplicity of this site is something that really stands out. Starting at the home page, interest is already created through the geometric shapes in the background that move with movement of the cursor, and entice the viewer to want to see more. The skill of this creative developer is shown through the animation of the background elements throughout and how the navigation from one page to the next is so seamless and unique in scrolling making pages change color and elements pop onto the screen. The simplicity of the information on the front page of each project leads to an organized abundance of information once clicked on, including helpful images of the work, color schemes used, articles, presentation, videos, and the like presented in a highly modern and seamless design that compliments each piece. Although the color schemes of each piece differ greatly from one another, their additional information design compliments each piece well when navigated upon. Overall, the site is unique, clean, exciting, and memorable.<br> <a href="https://www.raoul-gaillard.com/">Visit his site!</a></p>
